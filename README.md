This JavaScript code defines four utility functions to perform common tasks. Here's a brief explanation of each function and how to use them:

1. **greetUser(firstName, middleName, lastName)**: 
   - This function takes three name parameters (first, middle, and last) and prints a welcome message using those names.
   - Example: 
     ```js
     greetUser('Navleen', 'Simran', 'Jasman');
     ```
     Output: A greeting message with the names.

2. **convertMinutesToHours(minutes)**: 
   - This function takes a number of minutes as input and returns the equivalent number of hours, ignoring leftover minutes.
   - Example: 
     ```js
     let minutes = 60;
     let hours = convertMinutesToHours(minutes);
     console.log(`${minutes} minutes equal to ${hours} hours`);
     ```
     Output: "60 minutes equal to 1 hour"

3. **multiplyNumbers(...numbers)**: 
   - This function multiplies any number of input values together using the `reduce` method and returns the product.
   - Example:
     ```js
     let productResult = multiplyNumbers(12, 2, 5);
     console.log(`The product of 12, 2, and 5 is ${productResult}`);
     ```
     Output: The product of the provided numbers (e.g., 120).

4. **calculateSimpleInterest(principal, rate, time)**:
   - This function calculates simple interest based on the provided principal, interest rate (in percentage), and time (in years).
   - Example:
     ```js
     let principal = 2000;
     let rate = 2;
     let time = 5;
     let simpleInterest = calculateSimpleInterest(principal, rate, time);
     console.log(`The simple interest on $${principal} at ${rate}% for ${time} years is $${simpleInterest.toFixed(2)}`);
     ```
     Output: The calculated simple interest (formatted to two decimal places).

In practice, the functions are imported from a separate file (`utilities.js`) using:
```js
import { greetUser, convertMinutesToHours, multiplyNumbers, calculateSimpleInterest } from './utilities.js';
```
This allows you to call and use the functions as described.
